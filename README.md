# Memory-Game
Futurama Memory game uses the basic functionality of React

We set up our class on the App page to modify the image and score components to keep track of the rules.

The game is simple, Click as many images in a row without clicking the same image twice, the images are randomized each time you click one.

This app introduces the basic layout and functionality of React by using functions to manipulate the state in the components in order to establish the rules.
